Symbolic logic engine
Causal reasoning capabilities
Hypothesis generation and evaluation
Memory Systems:
Episodic, semantic, and procedural memory
Forgetting mechanisms
Memory consolidation processes
Neuromodulation:
Dopamine-inspired exploration/exploitation balance
Acetylcholine-based attention modulation
Norepinephrine-driven vigilance control
Scalability:
Distributed processing
Knowledge graph integration
Multi-agent coordination
